                            We also schedule a 2nd session with you, 1-2 weeks after you start implementing any changes so we can offer advice if you encounter any snags.
                            <br><br>
                            Spoiler: there will be no snags!
                            <br><br>
                            If we're building an email strategy for you, we'll walk through the new strategy together.
                            <br><br>
                            And once you start implementing, we'll have 4 (yep, four!) weekly check-ins, in case there's anything you want to sense check or discuss on your way to email nirvana!

                        I'm confused. What's the difference between newsletters, and sales emails?

                            All newsletters are emails, but not all emails are newsletters.
                            <br><br>
                            Sales emails are usually sequences with assertive sales messaging or promotions (killing short term engagement and harming long term deliverability), or broad cold-outbound campaigns used to fill your top of funnel (usually very unsustainable).

                            Most people think they don't need a strategy for email.
                            <br><br>
                            But those same people often have a strategy for social media... üëÄ
                            <br><br>
                            For example, you might have:
                            <br><br>
                            - a specific strategy for LinkedIn,<br>
                            - a specific strategy for Instagram,<br>
                            - a specific strategy for YouTube.
                            <br><br>
                            You might even employ somebody, part-time or full-time, to look after those strategies and to deliver those strategies.
                            <br><br>
                            But spend no time implementing a strategy for email.
                            <br><br>
                            Instead, you send an email "when you have the time", or "whenever you remember".
                            <br><br>
                            An email strategy takes your execution in email away from being a box-checking exercise.
                            <br><br>
                            It transforms email into a platform, and a channel that is equal to, or greater that socials.
                            <br><br>
                            One that's often FAR more effective than socials! Especially if you're already doing good stuff over there.
                            <br><br>
                            Having an email strategy means that when someone mentions email, your body temperature doesn't rise.
                            It means you understand the value of email and are extracting it. It means email is no longer a box checking exercise!
                            <br><br>
                            It's helps you achieve your business goals.

                            Both creators and businesses put a great deal of time, effort, and resource into <em>earning</em> attention.

                            Earning that attention in an effective way is how they're able to build a trusting relationship, and ultimately, to sell.
                            <br><br>
                            What VERY few creators and business do, is LEVERAGE the attention they've earned, by owning it (read:capturing an email).

                            Instead, they let 99% of the attention 'slip through the net'. And then when they want to get in front of those people again, they have to go out and EARN the attention <b>again</b>.
